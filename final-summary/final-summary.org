M. Dadlez investigates the rationality of emotional responses to fictions on the premise that emotions are related a person's cognition.In particular, he investigates the philosopher Colin Radford's claim that emotional responses to fiction are irrational, referring to cognitive accounts of emotion of other philosophers to support his investigation.There are two main sections of the article: (1) on emotions, cognition, and irrationality and (2) on fictional events and irrational emotions, along with a conclusive section at the end of the article.The first section begins with the cognitive accounts of emotion found in Aristotles' work, showing the relationship between a person's emotion and their perception of objects and situations.Specifically, that (1) from /Rhetoric/, certain emotions are tied to certain objects, (2) from /De Anima/, that emotions are never purely cognitive nor physiological, and (3) from /Nicomachean Ethics/, that there are certain criteria distinguishing justifiable and unjustifiable emotions (p. 291).Each case involves a focus on the subject's apprehension of an object or situation.Indeed, according to Irving Thalberg, any emotion involving objects are connected to some logical reasoning about the object (p. 291).In more contemporary accounts, emotions are said to involve 'construals' or evaluations of objects or situations.Dadlez gives an example of such construal: suppose Smith and Jones are having a philosophical dispute and Jones calls Smith by his first name in the middle of their dispute and Smith is offended by Jones' behavior.Certain philosophers might believe that Smith's construal was connected to a belief about Jones' behavior.An assessment of the rationality of Smith's emotional response may involve an attempt to determine the justification of his belief about Jones.If the assessment finds that Smith's belief of Jones was caused even partially due to emotions, then an assessment that his beliefs were unjustified may suggest that his emotions were irrational (p. 292).Otherwise if his beliefs were not at all emotionally motivated, then there is no discussion of rationality behind his emotions---his emotions would be nonrational.In another example, consider that Smith is working on his computer when suddenly it becomes unresponsive and he becomes frustrated at the computer, acting as though the computer is guilty of malicious obstrucionism or incompentence, despite believing that inanimate objects are unable to possess such characteristics (p. 293).His construal of the object is misaligned with his belief of the object and thus the resulting emotions of his construal are irrational.In general, this article section states that "depending on the specific cognitive account of emotion, an emotion is considered irrational when what is held to be a constituent belief is irrational, or when the construal associated with the emotion is at odds with what is believed of the intentional object" (p. 295).In other words, emotions are irrational when the belief of the object or situation is irrational, or when the emotion's associated construal contradicts the person's beliefs of the object or situation.The second section begins with a detailed description of Dadlez's emotional and physiological experience from watching the fictional film, /Alien/, where he fears for the character Ripley's life.According to Radford's claims, his emotional response to the film is an irrational response, as he believes and is aware that the situation and characters depicted in the film do not exist.In another example, a child may fear a stuffed tiger in a museum---the child believes that the tiger is stuffed, yet the child imagines that it is dangerous.The paradox is that emotional responses can be invoked despite a belief that the object or situation does not exist, yet emotional responses may only be invoked through a belief that the object or situation does exist---there is an inconsistency between the emotional response to the fiction and the belief about the fiction.One might suppose that a construal is rational if and only if the object or situation exists.To contradict this proposition, Dadlez considers the belief of hypothetical events, such as those of the environmentalist who concerns themselves of possible environmental disaster that may happen in the future, construing their hypothetical situation as distressing, yet construals are necessary but typically insufficient to invoke emotion.This case shows that "any any vivid imaginative construal could suggest irrationality, whether or not it involved emotion" (p. 297).Then are such imaginations irrational?It might be said that only construals constituent of emotions are irrational since there is lack of existential commitment, yet such selective inconsistency would undermine the rationality of respectable construals.Dadlez considers the difference between imagining of some existing thing that it has a certain property and the belief in the existence of something with a certain property, demonstrated in two cases: case (1) "There is a stuffed tiger of which \(S\) imagines that it is dangerous and of which he believes that it is not the case that it is dangerous: \((\exists x) [\text{Tx \& Im}(S, Dx) \text{ \& Bel}(S, -Dx)]\)" (p. 298) and case (2) "\(S\) imagines that there is a space alien that is dangerous and \(S\) believes that it's not the case that there's an alien that's dangerous: \(\text{Im}[S, (\exists x)(\text{Ax \& Dx})] \text{ \& Bel}[S, -(\exists x)(\text{Ax \& Dx})]\) (p. 298).Case 2 does not project the imaginary into reality since the existential quantifier is in the scope of the imaginary hence the imaginary does not contradict the belief.This is not the case for Case 1, where the imaginary does contradict the belief and suggests that the emotional response of \(S\) is irrational.This is analogous to the example in the first section, where Smith's imagination of the computer's properties contradicts his belief of the computer's properties (p. 298).In the conclusive section, Dadlez reiterates his argumentation and consolidates his stance that our emotional responses to fiction are not always irrational.Specifically, he asserts that, "the act of imagining a hypothetical human situation, and construing it in a particular way in doing so, is not irrational in itself," (p. 301) thus there is no basis that emotional responses to fictions are irrational.* Outline :noexport:** Introduction (p. 290)- Why do fictions engage the imagination to arouse fear, pity, or anger towards something in whose existence we do not believe?  Are such reactions rational?- Philosopher Colin Radford reads Anna Karenina and concludes that our emotional responses to fiction are irrational  + Other philosophers regularly criticize him, yet their criticisms rarely give an explicit definition of "emotion"  + What are the similarities/differences between emotional responses to fiction and to nonfiction?- Basis of discussion: Emotions have cognitive constituents or concomitants- Discussion topic: Cognitive accounts of emotion used to support investigation of Colin Radford's claim that emotional responses to fiction are irrational  - Such a claim makes sense only against a backdrop of assumptions which permit us to hold that there is some cognitive element of emotion which can be consistent or inconsistent with reason  - Once a set of candidate criteria for irrationality in emotion is established, an investigation of the claim that our emotional responses to fiction are irrational will be attempted  - It will be my contention that such a claim cannot be supported either on the basis of an analogy drawn to comparison cases or on the basis of a more general allegation of inconsistency** Emotions, Cognition, and Irrationality (pp. 291-295)- Many cognitivist accounts of emotion can be found in the work of Aristotle  + In /Rhetoric/: certain emotions are said to take certain objects    + E.g., contempt takes an object one considers or believes unimportant  + In /De Anima/: emotions are neither purely cognitive nor purely physiological  + In /Nicomachean Ethics/: describes criteria for which distinguish justifiable from unjustifiable emotions- In some most interesting contemporary accounts, emotions are said to involve 'construals' or evaluations of objects or situations  + How could we call someone's anger /irrational/ if it were merely a biochemical reaction over which that individual had not the slightest control?  + How could we consider an overprotective parent's dire foreboding about an offspring's plight unreasonable, if there were nothing /in/ or about the emotion itself to which reason could appeal?- Example which presents an account of emotion as construal:  + To be offended by someone's behavior might be described in terms of construing that behavior as rude and disrespectful  + Suppose Smith is offended by the familiarity of his younger colleague Jones, who addresses Smith by his first name during the course of a philosophical dispute.    Smith construes Jones' familiarity as disrespectful.    Such treatment, Smith feels, is incommensurate with his stature in the philosophical community.    Were I to call Smith's emotional response irrational (in the context of accounts which identify emotions with construals), I would be taking issue with Smith's construal of Jones' behavior /as/ a manifestation of disrespect, or taking issue with Smith's notion about what kinds of behavior constitute rudeness, or perhaps taking issue with Smith's assessment of the /degree/ of disrespect involved.    Usually, I would be questioning either Smith's appraisal or the grounds for it.- A number of philosophers would identify Smith's construal with a belief about Jones' behavior  + Example: Solomon might say that Smith made a hasty and dogmatic normative judgement about Jones and her behavior, since it is his contention that judgements are embedded in emotional responses.    The assessment of rationality might, in this case, involve an attempt to discover whether or not such a belief was justified.    If characterized as constituents of emotion or identified outright with emotions, unjustified beliefs could, on some accounts, invite the ascription of irrationality to the emotion itself.** Fictional Events and Irrational Emotions (pp. 295-301)** Conclusion (pp. 301-302)* Assignment
